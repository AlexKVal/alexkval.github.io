The library does it by exposing the StarCraft II Machine Learning API as a Python RL Environment.\nYou can learn more about the Reinforcement Learning by reading A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Deep Reinforcement Learning article. And also, here Wikipedia\nThe below are described the steps necessary to set up the working environment for it, so let‚Äôs make it happen.\nThe Homebrew is the preferred way to install packages for macOS, so make sure that it is installed.\nIn case it is not, here are the necessary steps.\nFirst, install the Command Line Tools for Xcode\nxcode-select --install Then accept the XCode license\nsudo xcodebuild -license accept Now we are ready to install the Homebrew\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\" Let‚Äôs make the installed brew command of the Homebrew project available in your terminal console. Add the following line\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH to your preferred shell‚Äôs profile. E.g. it could be .bash_profile, or .zshrc.\nIf you are unsure you can take the ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù way and use the .profile.\nIf you have no preferred text editor, you can use nano\nnano ~/.profile Insert that line export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH into the nano, then press Ctrl + o, then enter, and finally Ctrl + x.\nNow type\nsource ~/.profile (or whatever your preferred shell‚Äôs profile) for the added line to take effect, and then\nbrew update This way we update the brew package manager‚Äôs database.\nAnd here goes the tricky part.\nAt the moment of writing this article, the TensorFlow does not support yet Python 3.7 that is being installed by default with the Homebrew. We need to install the Python 3.6 for things to go smoothly later.\nLuckily there is a simple way for it.\nWe will use the python: update 3.6.5_1 bottle commit.\nIn case, you already have installed the Python 3.7 unlink it first\nbrew unlink python Note: this command won‚Äôt remove the 3.7 version from your system.\nThen install the Python 3.6\nbrew install --ignore-dependencies https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f2a764ef944b1080be64bd88dca9a1d80130c558/Formula/python.rb Now check that we have the right version\npython3 -V It should be Python 3.6.5.\nCongratulations üéâ.\nThe next step is not necessary but recommended.\nIt is useful for cases when you screw something up and would like to go ‚Äúfrom the scratch‚Äù.\nLet‚Äôs install and use the virtualenv\nmkdir ~/.virtualenvs pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper And to make it available in your terminal console, add these lines to your shell‚Äôs profile\n# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3 source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh and then load it for those lines to take effect\nsource ~/.profile (or whatever your shell‚Äôs preferred profile is).\nPay attention to the terminal output so there are no errors.\nNow we are ready to create a dedicated virtual environment which we‚Äôll use for our further setup.\nLet‚Äôs call it sc2.\nmkvirtualenv sc2 -p python3 After this command, your prompt should be prefixed with (sc2).\nIf you would like to switch to this virtual environment in another terminal tab, or get back to it after you‚Äôve closed your previous one, just type\nworkon sc2 Now we finally are ready to install the PySC2.\npip install pysc2 Now go to the https://www.blizzard.com and get the StarCraft II installed. The starter edition will suffice for our experiments.\nFor the PySC2 library to work we need to download and extract some additional materials.\nThe Ladder maps and Mini-games.\nThey go to the StarcraftII/Maps/ directory.\nThis folder does not exist by default so we should create it first.\ncd ‚Äú/Applications/StarCraft II‚Äù mkdir Maps open Maps Now download those archives and extract them into the newly created Maps folder.\nThe map packs are licensed.\nFollow the instructions here https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto.\nBasically, you just need to enter the iagreetotheeula in the password field while extracting those.
